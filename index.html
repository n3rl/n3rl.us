    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Neil Patram. In December 2024, I graduated from Georgia Tech with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science.
      My mathematical focus was primarily in convexity and high-dimensional phenomena, and my CS focus was mostly
      ML/AI-flavored. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently work as a full time math tutor at Georgia Gwinnett College. Previously I was an REU student at the University of Michigan (where I coauthored 
      a <a href=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12220-025-02199-7>paper</a> accepted to the <em>Journal of Geometric Analysis</em>), I interned at the Federal Reserve, 
      where I built NLP pipelines and data visualization tools, and I developed and ran automated tests at the Georgia Tech Research Institute. (I also worked back-of-house at Chick-fil-A,
	  but most people don't think the suffering of food service is worth mentioning when talking about work history.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides math, my interests include music composition (both acoustic and digital), writing (mainly poetry, but I've been taking a stab at sci-fi-esque topics),
	  linguistics (Spanish and Mandarin), and origami (I've tried my hand at designing a few models that you can find under the "misc" tab). Recently I've developed a strong interest in ornithology, and I volunteer as a bird 
      rehabilitator at Wild Nest Bird Rehab.
