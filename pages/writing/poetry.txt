after life

throw me in a river when i die,
or plant me in a deep ditch,
or lay me out in a field to dry;

let my dissolving feet commingle
with dissolving roots and leaves
as i cradle the Earth's
damp bounty from which i
emerged;

let me melt flourishingly
into soft earth,
seeping my way down
to some unseen vein
of lifewater pulsing below,
then gurgling up as a stream or brook;

let me feed the wild bird and grass,
the crawling ant, the spongy fungus;
i yield myself to them
like a tree yields its fruit,
so they may scatter me far and wide
till they return to dust themselves;

whatever you do,
do not give a grand speech;
do not trap me in a box
or seal me in a headstone;
do not bar me from this
raw afterlife, to which
all creatures under heaven
lay claim.

bajee

next harvest will be big, says my dad
who no longer chides my inattention
when a green arc leaps from his hand
into the basin, wetting my face
and darkening small circles
on the shoulder of his shirt.

he squints at the next batch,
gracefully prunes off the rot.
i did not help him 
(bent-backed in the garden,
where mosquitos hang like clouds)
to sever the leafy stems from the earth.

he has cut them down.
in time they will regrow;
for now we work in silence
to make of the remains something beautiful.
dust settles at the bottom of the rinsewater
and i lay the glittering stalks out to dry. 

###
christmas eve with my grandfather

the hospital room is silent as we enter;
the lobe of his old plaid hat
thrusts down over his eyes

when my father peels it back,
anchored in the waves of wrinkles
are two slits slightly ajar
that carry no white,
only an emptiness
that leads deep within him

from his bones
flesh drapes and pools
on the wrinkled sheets
into which his thin legs disappear,
his shirt clings to his swollen abdomen
like the skin of a balloon

i do not know this nose
or this ear
or this bottom lip that calls me 'grandson'
as it droops below a fence of yellowed teeth

our ties have long been severed;
no passion can renew
a heart by time atrophied

but no atrophy can extinguish passion:
it will live on, however irrational,
running hot inside you,
smoothing over the cracks
in your dry soul
and nourishing the better
nature lying dormant inside

'my grandfather'--
i will find those words in me,
wring them out drop by drop
when the time comes,
but for now i turn to the window;
the room overlooks
a lot lined with trees
whose arms raise tufts of withered leaves
as an offering to the wind

###
comparative geology

comparison is a teacher;
he can't be the thief of joy
until he steals what i do not have

you too can be his pupil,
if you are willing to venture on high,
to taste the cold winds
running circuits over the landscape of your past
splayed out raw and naked before you

follow with your eyes his finger
over hills rent by impenitent cliffs
down to where the waves dash themselves
against crumbling rock

he will give each blemish a name,
a past, and a future

be patient,
and learn to read these stories,
forged over lifetimes in the
splitting, bleeding, mending
skin of the earth

###
screaming

i've learned to scream onto paper,
to box up the squelching wetness
raking across my innards
into so many words,
each fluvial phrase containing
a squirming wormy tubule
so bulbous and bloated that the slightest graze
of a gaze breaks it loose.

yet i'll have failed if i
do not scream soft and wispy;
strained screams are uncouth
and amateur. no, i must scream
so beautifully no one
knows i am screaming, scream
in lowercase flowing flowery phrases,
scream and scream till i succeed
in interceding for myself
to myself.

###
somniphobe

sleep hungers for me

i dare not
open my mouth
i dare not
invite it in

or my name
like the raw white
of an egg
will be slurped up
into the parched darkness

###
stickygum

i wish to become a stick of gum
which succumbs to its place
as a fleeting flavor of fake taste
for the sake of making dawdling play for the jaws

which eschews not its duty
to be spewn out and forgotten
on the loss of its allotted utility

which with grace accepts its expected fate
so there escapes at most a moist squelch
as it is smashed against the underside of a table
or a soft swish as it is spit into the disposal

which, taking no offense, making no pretense,
is exactly what it is, exactly where it is,
forever.

###
summer words

this was our one summer gambol:
syrup-clouds above us amble,
	we wade through jade tangles of grass
	until we come upon, at last,
		a round stump of concrete.
we sit idly, side by side,
my mouth is opened wide
	to let out whatever I muse.
	you half-listen to this ruse
		and braid blades of grass.

i have a book. i keep it solely
because it opens soft and slowly.
	its pages part and come to rest
	at the place where there is pressed
		your unity of thirds.
		i regret i gave you only words.

###
sweet dreams

by morning i will have forgotten
Myself, who dared to dream
these dreams
and feel these fancy fantasies;
when i wake, he is relegated
to his fate below the tides
of the dark underside of my mind.

but just for tonight
i plunge into that shadow
in pursuit of Myself, who,
ever vague and hazy,
feints and floats away
laughing when i lunge at him,
embracing the dead space
which separates my fingers from his wrist
as i stumble over my own weight.

again and again he beckons.

my soles are sore,
my arms are aching,
yet i am hardened by my stubborn and scarred ardor
which can't stamp out the fantasy
of chance at last glancing favorably upon me.

i prepare to lunge again.
i might catch him.
i might not.
by morning i will have forgotten.

###
the last song of the kaua'i 'o'o

there is so much,
sweet bird,
you do not know.

perched atop your barren world,
you know only a pain which down to you distills
as a loneliness without cause
and without cease.
if instinct's automaton
can churn out such despair,
i feel with you;
if not, then for you.

i will go on thinking,
thinking and thinking
until the world is full of you,
sweet bird,
and i can hear your voice issue
from every green bough, gushing over
smooth stones as it meanders
down to the vast Pacific.

meanwhile, time will go on
chiseling out memories from this mortal coil.
you do not--
we do not--
know how it happens.

so go on singing, too,
sweet bird.
let me hear the elegy,
belted crisp and clear
from your heaving chest
all those decades ago,
meld like smoke into the night.

###
thread

i used to sneer at life and love
and laugh at the red thread of fate
and i was stupid and dumb and brainless and wrong, but
in my defense i did not exist;
was i alive?
was i conscious of a single thing
before i felt our fingers weave together,
before i felt them mesh and draw us tight,
and stitch our souls into a tapestry
of intertwining worlds?

###
unowned things

my dreams washed clean off
when i fell into you.
only my form escaped.
and it still wanders
among littered leaves,
whispering the sad song
of unowned things,
asking itself the riddle:
what eats and breathes and sleeps
but never dreams?

###
wren

this afternoon as i was
staring out the window,
shredding myself into a heap
of unwieldy thoughts, a wren 
lighted like a bright idea
at the flagpole's end,
his tiny beak clutching
scraps for a nest,
his tiny head craning curiously
every which way.

little wren,
whisk a scrap of me away
when you leave,
weave it in with the
other frayed, forgotten things;
teach it feathery comfort,
the delights of instinct,
and everything else i cannot;
let it for the first time know
the many warmths of being loved.

###
epicycles

we spin simply, they say, in an elliptic groove;
	to pretend we don't is of no use
to anyone. not so; joined, we are
	the loose pirouette of a star
in its divine wanderings, 
	a tuning of the celestial strings
so each stolid precession resolves
	to something warmer, to a calm
and wayfaring shape, a widening thrust,
	with no truth or name, save Us.

and even if fiction is
	the price of fixedness
on an ever spinning planet,
	who says it can't be elegant?
as long as they deem us primitive breeds,
	as long as they dream up worlds
grinding coldly along fated paths,
	they will be lost and lampless,
		they will never grasp
			the beautiful, circuitous Us.
