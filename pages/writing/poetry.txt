###
christmas eve with my grandfather

the hospital room is silent as we enter;
the lobe of his old plaid hat
thrusts down over his eyes

when my father peels it back,
anchored in the waves of wrinkles
are two slits slightly ajar
that carry no white,
only an emptiness
that leads deep within him

from his bones
flesh drapes and pools
on the wrinkled sheets
into which his thin legs disappear,
his shirt clings to his swollen abdomen
like the skin of a balloon

i do not know this nose
or this ear
or this bottom lip that calls me 'grandson'
as it droops below a fence of yellowed teeth

our ties have long been severed;
no passion can renew
a heart by time atrophied

but no atrophy can extinguish passion:
it will live on, however irrational,
running hot inside you,
smoothing over the cracks
in your dry soul
and nourishing the better
nature lying dormant inside

'my grandfather'--
i will find those words in me,
wring them out drop by drop
when the time comes,
but for now i turn to the window;
the room overlooks
a lot lined with trees
whose arms raise tufts of withered leaves
as an offering to the wind

comparative geology

comparison is a teacher;
he can't be the thief of joy
until he steals what i do not have

you too can be his pupil,
if you are willing to venture on high,
to taste the cold winds
running circuits over the landscape of your past
splayed out raw and naked before you

follow with your eyes his finger
over hills rent by impenitent cliffs
down to where the waves dash themselves
against crumbling rock

he will give each blemish a name,
a past, and a future

be patient,
and learn to read these stories,
forged over lifetimes in the
splitting, bleeding, mending
skin of the earth

somniphobe

sleep hungers for me

i dare not
open my mouth
i dare not
invite it in

or my name
like the raw white
of an egg
will be slurped up
into the parched darkness

###
stickygum

i wish to become a stick of gum
which succumbs to its place
as a fleeting flavor of fake taste
for the sake of making dawdling play for the jaws

which eschews not its duty
to be spewn out and forgotten
on the loss of its allotted utility

which with grace accepts its expected fate
so there escapes at most a moist squelch
as it is smashed against the underside of a table
or a soft swish as it is spit into the disposal

which, taking no offense, making no pretense,
is exactly what it is, exactly where it is,
forever.

###
sweet dreams

by morning i will have forgotten
Myself, who dared to dream
these dreams
and feel these fancy fantasies;
when i wake, he is relegated
to his fate below the tides
of the dark underside of my mind.

but just for tonight
i plunge into that shadow
in pursuit of Myself, who,
ever vague and hazy,
feints and floats away
laughing when i lunge at him,
embracing the dead space
which separates my fingers from his wrist
as i stumble over my own weight.

again and again he beckons.

my soles are sore,
my arms are aching,
yet i am hardened by my stubborn and scarred ardor
which can't stamp out the fantasy
of chance at last glancing favorably upon me.

i prepare to lunge again.
i might catch him.
i might not.
by morning i will have forgotten.

the last song of the kaua'i 'o'o

there is so much,
sweet bird,
you do not know.

perched atop your barren world,
you know only a pain which down to you distills
as a loneliness without cause
and without cease.
if instinct's automaton
can churn out such despair,
i feel with you;
if not, then for you.

i will go on thinking,
thinking and thinking
until the world is full of you,
sweet bird,
and i can hear your voice issue
from every green bough, gushing over
smooth stones as it meanders
down to the vast Pacific.

meanwhile, time will go on
chiseling out memories from this mortal coil.
you do not--
we do not--
know how it happens.

so go on singing, too,
sweet bird.
let me hear the elegy,
belted crisp and clear
from your heaving chest
all those decades ago,
meld like smoke into the night.

###
thread

i used to sneer at life and love
and laugh at the red thread of fate
and i was stupid and dumb and brainless and wrong, but
in my defense i did not exist;
was i alive?
was i conscious of a single thing
before i felt our fingers weave together,
before i felt them mesh and draw us tight,
and stitch our souls into a tapestry
of intertwining worlds?

###
unowned things

my dreams washed clean off
when i fell into you.
only my form escaped.
and it still wanders
among littered leaves,
whispering the sad song
of unowned things,
asking itself the riddle:
what eats and breathes and sleeps
but never dreams?
